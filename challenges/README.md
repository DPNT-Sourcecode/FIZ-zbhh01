This folder will contain challenge descriptions.

## Challenge 1
- param[0] = a positive integer between 0-100
- param[1] = a positive integer between 0-100
- @return = an Integer representing the sum of the two numbers

The test has already been written and I can see that is fails
I will now implement the code
Note that on closer inspection the tests do not check that the numbers are in the range given
I will extend the tests.
#I have failed to work out how to write the test so I am moving on to refactoring
