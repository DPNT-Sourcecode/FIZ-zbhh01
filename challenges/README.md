This folder will contain challenge descriptions.
## The Challenge 1
In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     sum(Integer, Integer) -> Integer
A test framework has been provided but I know that this will not help me later so I'm making my own.

## Challenge 2
In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     hello(String) -> String
The requirements state that the result should say hello to the world.
I am going to assume that this requires an output of 'Hello World!'

## Challenge 3
You are given the name of a friend. Say hello to them!
Example: if name of friend is "John" than return "Hello, John!".
I am going to extend the last challenge
